# LeetCode Problems in Java

## 62. Unique Paths

Using dynamic programming, we initialize a 2d array and fill the array with its base cases.

## 46. Permutations

Using depth-first search, we add each combination and at the end, we remove the last item in the list.

## 152. Maximum Product Subarray

Using kadane's algorithm O(n), time O(1) space, we keep track of the maximum product subarray and we traverse the array from left to right and right to left.

## 70. Climbing Stairs

Using dynamic programming, similar to the fibonacci sequence, we initialize an array of size n+1 with base cases dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1.
